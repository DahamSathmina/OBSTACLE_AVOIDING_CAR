⚙️ Installation and Setup

Clone this repository:

        git clone https://github.com/your-username/Obstacle-Avoiding-Car.git

Open the .ino file in the Arduino IDE.

Connect the components as per the circuit diagram.

Select the correct board and port in Arduino IDE.

Upload the code to your Arduino board.


🚀 Usage

Once powered on, the car will start moving forward.

When it detects an obstacle, it will stop, scan for a clear path, and turn accordingly.

The ultrasonic sensor helps it navigate and avoid collisions dynamically.


📝 Code Explanation

The code utilizes:

Ultrasonic Sensor to measure the distance to obstacles.

Motor Driver Module (L293D) to control the speed and direction of the motors efficiently.

Servo Motor (Optional) to rotate the sensor for scanning.
Arduino Programming to process sensor data and control the car's movements.


🔮 Future Improvements

Adding a Bluetooth module for manual control via a mobile app.

Implementing an AI-based path planning algorithm.

Using additional sensors (IR, LIDAR) for better navigation.

Integrating GPS for route tracking.
