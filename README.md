🚀 Usage


🔛 Once powered on, the car will start moving forward.
🚧 When it detects an obstacle, it will stop, scan for a clear path, and turn accordingly.
🎯 The ultrasonic sensor helps it navigate and avoid collisions dynamically.

📝 Code Explanation


The code utilizes:

📡 Ultrasonic Sensor to measure the distance to obstacles.
⚙️ Motor Driver Module (L293D) to control the speed and direction of the motors efficiently.
🔄 Servo Motor (Optional) to rotate the sensor for scanning.
🖥 Arduino Programming to process sensor data and control the car's movements.


🚀 Future Improvements


📱 Adding a Bluetooth module for manual control via a mobile app.
🧠 Implementing an AI-based path planning algorithm.
🎯 Using additional sensors (IR, LIDAR) for better navigation.
🌍 Integrating GPS for route tracking.
